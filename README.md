# Caesar-Cipher
Implementing Caesar-Cipher using JAVAFX
Here, I have used two textFields each for encryption and decryption respectively.
Data entered into plainText textField is encrypted and return on encrypted textField.
This data printed is known as Cipher-text or we can say encrypted text.
Data we put for encryption in plainText textField is known as plaintext or we can say raw data.
Caesar-Cipher takes a key value which is used for encryption.
